# DNS / DHCP Azure AD SSO Provisioning

## Authentication with Azure AD

Azure AD provides the authorization backend, via [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), and is manually provisioned following the guide below.

## Caveats

- Due to the session time in Cognito, changes to users and / or roles for users
 whom have already signed into the admin portal can take up to around 15 minutes
 to propagate to the admin system. This is because updated sessions are only pulled from Azure once a Cognito session has timed out.

## Prerequisites

- You will need access to the Devl MoJ Azure account.
- In Azure you will need to elevate your permissions using `Privileged Identity Management (PIM)`
    1. In `Privileged Identity Management`, go to `My roles`
    1. Under `Eligible assignments`, find the `Application Administrator` role and select `Activate on the right
    1. Specify a reason then select `Activate`

- You should now have the role of `Application Administrator` under `Active assignments`

## Creating the basic app

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to `Enterprise Applications`
1. Click `Add` application
1. Select `Amazon Web Services (AWS)` application from the list of predefined services
1. Change the application name to `staff-device-[ENVIRONMENT_NAME]-dns-dhcp-admin-azure-app`
1. Click `Add`. Creating the app may take a few moments. You will eventually be redirected to the config page

1. On the left-hand menu, select `Single sign-on` and select `SAML`
![Select SAML configuration](azure-images/select-saml.png)

1. In the `SAML Signing Certificate` section grab the `App Federation Metadata URL`. This is required to be added to the `terraform.tfvars` file under `azure_federation_metadata_url`.  
In production like environments, this needs to be added to SSM Parameter store (See `TF_VAR_azure_federation_metadata_url` in [`buildspec.yml`](buildspec.yml) for the correct SSM key)

## Configuring URLs

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to `Enterprise Applications`
1. Search for the application name, i.e. `staff-device-[ENVIRONMENT_NAME]-dns-dhcp-admin-azure-app` and select it
1. On the left-hand menu, select `Single sign-on`
1. Select `Edit` in `Basic SAML Configuration`
![Basic SAML configuration](azure-images/basic-saml-configuration.png)

1. Fill in the `Identifier (Entity ID)` with `urn:amazon:cognito:sp:[COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID]`
  To find the COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID:
    1. In the AWS Console, navigate to `Cognito` then `Manage User Pools` and select your app
    1. Under `General Settings` locate `Pool Id`
1. Fill in the `Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)` with `https://[COGNITO_DOMAIN]/saml2/idpresponse`
  To find the COGNITO_DOMAIN:
    1. In the AWS Console, navigate to `Cognito` then `Manage User Pools` and select your app
    1. Under `App Integrations` then `Domain name`, locate the full domain, i.e. `https://some-user-pool-name.auth.eu-west-2.amazoncognito.com`
1. Fill in the `Logout Url` with output from Terraform

1. Save the changes once you are done

## Configuring roles

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to `App Registrations`
1. Under `All applications`, search for the application name (used to create the app above). i.e. `staff-device-[ENVIRONMENT_NAME]-dns-dhcp-admin-azure-app` and click to navigate to the configuration page
1. Select `Manifest` in the left hand menu bar
1. Add 2 new roles to the existing `appRoles` section for editor and viewer.
    - Do not delete the existing `msiam_access` role
    - A unique GUID must be created for each of the new roles. These can be created [here](https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx)

    ```json
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "User"
      ],
      "description": "Viewer users have the ability to view DNS/DHCP configurations.",
      "displayName": "Viewer",
      "id": MY_CUSTOM_GUID,
      "isEnabled": true,
      "lang": null,
      "origin": "Application",
      "value": "viewer"
    },
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "User"
      ],
      "description": "Editor users have the ability to create, delete and update DNS/DHCP configurations.",
      "displayName": "Editor",
      "id": MY_CUSTOM_GUID,
      "isEnabled": true,
      "lang": null,
      "origin": "Application",
      "value": "editor"
    }
    ```

1. Save the changes to the manifest

## Assigning roles to users

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to `Enterprise Applications`
1. Search for the application name, ie `staff-device-[ENVIRONMENT_NAME]-dns-dhcp-admin-azure-app` and select it
1. On the left-hand menu, select `Users and groups`
1. At the top of the user list select `Add user`
1. On the `Add assignment page` click `Users and groups`. Search for the user you would like to add to the application
![Select a user](azure-images/user-assignment.png)

1. Back on the `Add assignment page` click `Select a role`. Click on the role and then click `select`
![Select a role](azure-images/role-assignment.png)
1. Click on `Assign`. You will now see your user in the list of users with the role assignment
