# DNS / DHCP AWS Infrastructure

## Run locally

Initialise the repo:

```shell
  aws-vault exec moj-pttp-shared-services -- make init
```

Create your workspace

```shell
  aws-vault exec moj-pttp-shared-services -- terraform workspace new "your-user-name"
```

Select your workspace

```shell
  aws-vault exec moj-pttp-shared-services -- terraform workspace select "your-user-name"
```

Select your workspace

```shell
  aws-vault exec moj-pttp-shared-services -- terraform apply
```

### Destroying infrastructure

The process of destroying infrastructure is an automated 2 step process that has been encapsulated in a Makefile command.

Run:

```shell
make destroy # note no aws-vault prefix required as this is in the Makefile 
```

This will:
1. Remove the Auto scaling group for the DNS and DHCP servers through the AWS command line
2. Run `terraform destroy` after that to destroy the remaining services.

*This is a workaround for a dependency bug in Terraform where the order within which services are torn down is incorrect.
By default Terraform will attempt to destroy the ECS service / cluster before removing the auto scaling group.
This will result in a timeout as the EC2 instances within the auto scaling group are still running.*

## Docker images

The ISC Kea DHCP service hosted by this service runs in a Docker container.
The code for building this container can be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-dhcp-server).

## Authentication with Azure AD

Azure AD provides our authorization backend and is not provisioned through CLI/Terraform. Follow this guide for manual steps to build Azure AD infrastructure.

## Corsham Test site

We do remote testing of the DHCP service from a virtual machine running in Corsham.
To access this VM you need to go through the bastion set up in production, which is on the same network (via the Transit Gateway) as the VM.

Follow the steps below to run the tests:

### SSH onto the bastion server

1. Log into the production AWS console, and go to the SSM Parameter Store.

2. Copy the contents of the SSH key kept under `/corsham/testing/bastion/private_key` and save it to a local file corsham_test.pem

3. Change the permission of the pem file by running: 

```bash
chmod 600 corsham_test.pem
```

4. Copy the IP address of the bastion server found under `/corsham/testing/bastion/ip` (refered to as <BASTION_IP> below)

5. SSH onto the bastion server:

```bash
ssh -i corsham_test.pem ubuntu@<BASTION_IP>
```

### SSH onto the Corsham VM from the bastion server

6. Copy the IP address for the VM found under `/corsham/testing/vm/ip_address` in SSM  (referred to as <VM_IP> below)

7. Copy the SSH password for the VM found under `/corsham/testing/vm/password` in SSM (referred to as <VM_PASSWORD> below)

8. SSH onto the Corsham VM:

```bash
ssh root@<VM_IP>
```

9. When prompted for the password enter <VM_PASSWORD>

### Run the docker container

There is a Dockerfile on the VM, based on the Dockerfile used for the DHCP KEA server itself.
It is already configured to point to the production DHCP Network Load Balancer.

10. Build and run the container

```bash
cd ~/
docker build --network host -t test .
docker run --network host -t test
```

The results of the test will display when perfdhcp has completed.
